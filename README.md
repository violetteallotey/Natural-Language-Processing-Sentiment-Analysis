# Natural-Language-Processing-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I will fine-tune a pre-trained Deep Learning models from HuggingFace on a new dataset to adapt the models to predict the sentiments expressed in a Tweet (e.g: neutral, positive, negative). I will then create an app to use the models and deploy the app on the HuggingFace platform.

## Overview
This is a sentiment analysis app built with Streamlit. It predicts the sentiments expressed in an input text and provides a visual representation of the sentiment scores.
